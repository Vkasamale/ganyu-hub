# Changelog

A running log of what has actually shipped, newest first. For the product
vision and unresolved decisions, see [`PROJECT_BRIEF.md`](PROJECT_BRIEF.md).

## 2026-06-25 — In-app notifications (P0)

Realtime notification layer so the platform stops being a silent dead drop.

- New schema: `notifications` table, `notification_kind` enum (`proposal_received`, `proposal_accepted`, `proposal_declined`, `message_received`), RLS scoped to owner, added to `supabase_realtime` publication
- Notifications inserted from `submitProposal`, `decideProposal`, `sendMessage`
- New server actions: `markNotificationRead`, `markAllNotificationsRead`
- New `<NotificationBell>` client component in the navbar — unread badge, dropdown, "mark all read", live-updating via Supabase Realtime channel `notifications:<user_id>`
- Each notification links to the relevant job or message thread

**Migration required:** re-run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor before testing.

## 2026-06-24 — Save/bookmark + For You + Trending feed (`69e4084`)

The social-feed layer on top of the marketplace.

- New schema: `interactions`, `saved_items`, and a `trending_items` RPC
- Heart/save button on every creative + job card and detail page
- New `/dashboard/saved` page listing saved creatives and jobs
- Dashboard now shows two role-aware rails:
  - **For You** — clients see creatives, creatives see jobs (matched by category)
  - **Trending this week** — most-viewed in the last 7 days
- Detail pages record view interactions, feeding Trending and future personalization
- New server actions: `toggleSave`, `recordView`
- New helper module `lib/feed.ts`

## 2026-06-24 — Search + filters on /browse and /jobs (`479aa2c`)

URL-driven filtering on both browse pages.

- New `<FiltersBar>` component (text search, multi-select categories, skills tag input, price range, sort)
- `/browse` filters creatives by name/headline/bio match, category overlap, skill overlap, hourly-rate range
- `/jobs` filters open jobs by title/brief match, category, budget range
- Filters are URL params, so results are shareable and back/forward work
- Result count and Clear button on both pages
