Tracks what's been hands-on tested vs. what's been built but not yet confirmed working. Works alongside [`GanyuHub_DevRoadmap.md`](GanyuHub_DevRoadmap.md) (what to build) and [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) (known issues to fix later).

## 🕒 Prompted to test — 2026-07-08 batch (awaiting confirmation)

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Mobile dashboard nav dropdown | Native `<details>` — collapsed by default on <md, shows current page as label |
| Image upload: profile cover photo | Wide picker on `/dashboard/profile`, renders as banner on public profile |
| Image upload: profile avatar | Renders on public profile now (was always initials) |
| Image upload: creative-onboarding piece cover | File picker replaced URL text input |
| ImagePicker wide layout | Button now stacks under preview (was pushed off-row) |
| Public profile header positioning | Only avatar straddles banner seam; name/headline fully in white |
| Categories expanded to 24 | Add each new one via CategoryPicker on profile edit; browse filter finds them |
| Searchable CategoryPicker | Type in the search box on `/browse` filters; chip list narrows live |
| Landing category rotator | Batch swap every ~3.8s; hover pauses; See all 24 → link works |
| Payments dashboard charts | Bar chart + escrow donut render; empty state when no data |
| Portfolio item detail page rebuild | Hero + sidebar + more-from-creator all render |

## ⚠️ Tested, known issue (tracked in BACKLOG)

| Feature | Issue | Backlog item |
|---|---|---|
| In-app notification latency | ~30s end-to-end during testing | "Notification latency" |
| Email delivery to anyone other than `vinnykasa@gmail.com` | Resend sandbox only delivers to account owner until `ganyu.com` domain verifies | "Verify ganyu.com in Resend" |
| Email: proposal accepted (creative side) | Not received — same domain issue | Same as above |
| Email: job completed (either side) | Not received — same domain issue | Same as above |
| Account → change email | `updateAccount` correctly calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ email })`; SavingForm now surfaces the `info` message ("Check your inbox to confirm the new email."). Email swap requires clicking Supabase confirmation link in the new (and, if secure email change is on, old) inbox — this is by design, not a bug. Full end-to-end swap not yet confirmed | Track in BACKLOG if Supabase confirmation redirect URL isn't set correctly |

## ⬜ Never tested

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Proposal limit — "job full" card at cap | Skipped this session: default cap is 10 proposals/job (see `app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` `proposalLimit`); seeding 10 proposals from 10 distinct creatives just to hit the cap is heavier scaffolding than the "keep specs minimal" constraint allows. Revisit if a lower per-job cap becomes easy to set via seed/admin. |
| Job / creative filters (`<FiltersBar>`) | Category, skills, price range, sort — also in BACKLOG |
| Search (`?q=`) on `/browse` and `/jobs` | Title + brief ILIKE — never hands-on tested since shipping |
| For You / Trending feed correctness | Categories match, view counts populate correctly |
| Saved items (`/dashboard/saved`) round-trip | Save/unsave, page reflects state |
| Public profile rendering for an unsigned visitor | No "Message" or "Request quote" buttons should appear |
| Job posted by client visible on their `/dashboard/jobs` | Should appear under Active |
| `recordView` actually populating `interactions` | Needed for Trending |
| Multi-browser realtime test (two real browsers, not just tabs) | Confirms it's not just Next router-refresh |

## Responsiveness & UI polish (mostly untested)

- Mobile breakpoint (<640px): navbar, dashboard tiles, job detail panel stack
- Tablet breakpoint (640–1024px): rate card grid, jobs list density
- Notification dropdown clipping on small screens
- User menu dropdown clipping (right-edge `right-0` should be fine, but verify)
- Long full_name truncation in user menu trigger (set to `max-w-[120px]`)
- Long category/skill arrays wrapping cleanly on profiles
- Empty states across pages (no jobs, no proposals, no notifications)
- Color contrast on the brand red against white / neutral-50 backgrounds

## Process

- When a 🕒 item is verified, move it to ✅ or ⚠️
- When a ⚠️ item ships a fix, move it back to ✅ and clear the backlog row
- New build → add 🕒 items to "Prompted to test" so they don't get forgotten
